	 * Definition:
	 * Binary tree - is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, 
	 *               which are referred to as the left child and the right child.
	 *               
	 *
	 * In this assignment, given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself. 
	 * A binary tree is called to be a mirror of itself if it is symmetric around its center.
	 * 
	 * For example, 
	 * Symmetric binary trees:
	 *       1             1
     *      / \           / \
     *     2   2         2   2
     *    / \ / \       /     \
     *   3  4 4  3     3       3
     *   
     *  
     * Not symmetric binary trees:  
     *      1              1
     *     / \            / \
     *    2   2          2   2
     *     \   \        /     \
     *      3    3     3       5
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Notice that an empty tree is symmetric.
	 * 
	 * This question may be solved both recursively and iteratively.
	 * 
	 * @param root - a root of the binary tree
	 * @return true if the tree is a mirror of itself, otherwise return false.

	/*
	 * Second question:
	 * 
	 * Given a linked list, rotate it to the right by k places, where k is non-negative.
	 * 
	 * For example:
	 * Given:  1->2->3->4->5->NULL and k = 1
	 * Return: 5->1->2->3->4->NULL
	 * 
	 * Given:  1->2->3->4->5->NULL and k = 2
	 * Return: 4->5->1->2->3->NULL
