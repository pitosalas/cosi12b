#### Background
You've received this because you signed up for Pito's Weekly Programming Challenge. As you know this is 100% opt-in. It is not required, it is not graded, and it's not for credit. However if you feel you are struggling with some of the basics, and you are serious enough to take action, then try this for a week and we will discuss how it goes.

##### Instructions
