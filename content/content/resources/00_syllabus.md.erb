#### Introduction

*Knowing how to program is a poweful thing. Nowadays software has an important role in just about any discipline, from Physics to Robotics, from Medicine to Computer Science. For me, learning to program is learning a new medium. Like writing or mathematics, programming is a creative, rewarding and powerful tool that is also amazingly fun! I believe that deeply and I hope to have you discover that for yourself. Therefore my overall goal for this course for you is to continue the journey to being a brave and confident software developer. To be inquisitive and self-reliant, comfortable in taking on new challenges.*

#### Content and Objectives

This course continues what you learned in Cosi 11a, and in particular:

1. *Java concepts and practices*: You will complete your learning and understanding of Java as a programming language; introduce and get you comfortable with the wide variety of java libraries and tools used by professional programmers. We will Cover  issues related to the definition, creation and usage of classes, objects and methods. We will discuss the principles of inheritance and polymorphism and demonstrate through problem analysis assignments how they relate to the design of methods, abstract classes and interfaces. We will cover the basics of creating APIs as well as allow students to explore the Java Abstract Programming Interface (API) and Java Collection Framework through programming assignments.
1. *Object Orientation:* Upon completion of this class, students will be able to understand the concept of object-oriented programming (OOP) as well as the purpose and usage of inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation and method overloading. They will be able to create Java application programs using sound OOP practices (e.g., interfaces and APIs) and proper program structuring. They will also learn the new features of Java 8 such as streams and lambdas.
1. *Program design and development*: You will get a lot of practice programming and designing programs built up of multiple classes. Decomposing a problem statement and breaking it into steps that can be programmed. Understanding what of all the capabilities available can be used to solve the problem.
1. *Software Development as a discipline*: You will begin seeing "Software Development" as something beyond programming, encompassing design, development tools, libraries, debugging and testing and other processes. You will learn good programming skills as we discuss key issues in the design of object-oriented software, including programming design patterns and unit testing.

#### Class and Recitations
* Class will be in 3 50 minute sessions on Mon, Wed and Thur. In class there are often tiny pass/fail quizes, as well as reading assignments.
* Recitation is once a week for 50 minutes, and is **mandatory**. This is when you will learn about the weekly Programming Assignment and get tips to help you through it.
