#### Classes are "Cookie Cutters"
* Objects can actually do something
* Why? You cannot eat the cookie cutter
* But, you can use it to make 100 cookies.
* That you can eat.
* Class -> Cookie Cutter
* Object -> Actual cookie

#### Point Class Example

<%= code_begin %>
public class Point {
  int x;
  int y;
}
<%= code_end %>

* A `class` is a "template" or "cookie cutter" or "blueprint"
* It defines a new named type  with a name
* The class above is called `Point`
* Point class above has two `fields`
  * "int" called x
  * "int" called y
* Use a class by creating an `object` based on it
* Each object so created has a copy of the fields
