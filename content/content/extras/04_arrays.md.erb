#### What is an "array"?
* All(most) all programming languages have them
* An object that stores many values of the **same type**
  * An index is a like a subscript
  * An array is like a matrix
* Each value is accessed by an **index**
  * Each floor in a building has a number
  * Each street in New York City has a number
  * More examples?
* **CONFUSING**: Indexes start at zero!!!

#### Example

<%= code_begin %>
int[] scores = new int[3];
score[0] = 100;
score[1] = 200;
score[2] =300;

int average;
average = (score[0]+score[1]+score[2])/3
System.out.println("The average is: " + average);

<%= code_end %>

#### Declaration
* `int grade[] = new int[30];`
* So, \<type\> \<varname\> = new \<type\>[\<arraysize\>]`

<%= callout("NB", " All elements of an array are of the same datatype") %>
<%= callout("NB", " You have to decide how many elements the array has ahead of time") %>
